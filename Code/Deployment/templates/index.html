                maintenance behavior, this machine learning research will be focused on providing a framework for predicting the aircraft's remaining usable life (RUL) based on the whole life 
                cycle data. Using the NASA C-MAPSS data set is implemented and tested to determine the engine lifetime.
                
                Tracking and predicting the progression of damage in aircraft engine turbo machinery has some roots in the work of Kurosaki. They estimate the efficiency and the flow rate deviation
                of the compressor and the turbine based on operational data, and utilize this information for fault detection purposes.
                 
                A low pressure compressor (LPC) and high pressure compressor (HPC) supply compressed high temperature, high pressure gases to the combustor. Low pressure turbine (LPT) can 
                decelerate and pressurize air to improve the chemical energy conversion efficiency of aviation kerosene. High pressure turbines (HPT) generate mechanical energy by using high 
                temperature and high pressure gas strike turbine blades. Low-pressure rotor (N1), high-pressure rotor (N2), and nozzle guarantee the combustion efficiency of the engine.
                
                Our main focus will be on accurately recording low RUL values to prevent putting the engine at danger and forecasting the RUL of the turbofan engine while accounting for HPC 
                failure. Data analysis, data visualization and Model development are covered in this project</p>
